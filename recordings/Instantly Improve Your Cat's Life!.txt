What is up my feline friends? No my feline loving friends that's not cool. Friends of furry feline's. Which works for everybody unless you have a hairless cat. Anyway what's up? Today we're going to talk about something that I always geek out on and there's always a problem but I think I have a solution to the problem. But suspense. What could it possibly be? Okay anyway today we are going to talk about caddification, a barrier to caddification, and a solution to the barrier. Let's start first with caddification. If you don't know yet and there's plenty of videos on this channel all about it. There's a playlist you can go check out but let me just cut to the cliff notes here. Caddification is the idea of environmental enrichment for cats but caddification itself is not just the environmental enrichment. It's the other side. The other side being you and it having to work aesthetically budget wise and all that for you. It's the meeting point. That's caddification. Why is environmental enrichment so so important for your cat? The answer lies in the raw cat. You know the ancestor that I've spoken so much about and the fact that that ancestor and your cat there's a string that connects them. Everything that your cat does on any given day is informed by the raw cat and the raw cat has things that make the raw cat feel totally confident. That's called cat mojo. If the raw cat is happy your cat's happy. So one of those things about mojo that is a given is ownership of territory. Owning this defined place of square footage. It's like humans putting that little white picket fence around our homes. It defines us and when we look at that fence we go yeah yeah I live here you know just like that. For your cat part of that is how they see the room. So for instance if your cat's sitting right here on the arm of this chair eventually their scent will get in it and they're going to feel a sense of ownership but here's the thing. Ownership for a cat is not just here. It's there. It's there. It's there. It's everywhere. It's not about the ground. It's from the floor to the ceiling because cats own the sky. Caddification becomes that way of uniting. Floor to ceiling every place in between and give that raw cat and your cat the cat mojo to say I own this place. Ah. What is the barrier in your mind to catifying space knowing how important it is? Well one of those things could be the concept of paralysis by analysis that you actually you know knowing that I've had these beautiful examples we've got two books filled with beautiful examples of uh caddification and if you watched my cat from hell over the years you've seen us do these incredible transformations of spaces I mean incredible and Kate Benjamin comes in there with me we go hmm what are we gonna do and kaboom don't forget we had a budget you know it being tv we had people to help put it together because you know tv it was a whole thing you know I always thought to myself are we sending a message that it's just too much and so here you are sitting in this room in your house you know the living room which is an amazing place to start socially significant cats are always going to be there anyway and you're looking around you're going okay well I don't know how to start this and then you just don't I will say this number one that quote that I love so very much don't let perfection be the enemy of good so let's just find that place that place in the room to plant the flag of caddification and say let's just let the enrichment begin let's make our cats happy let's make it easy on me because I got a whole day full of stuff I got it too instead of looking at a blank wall think about urban planning think about the fact that you just founded a city this city right here is mojo ville I now declare this mojo ville and now you've got this space and you got to start designing flow to your world well one of the things you want to think about is how are you going to get around that world what's the important parts of that world and think about it in terms of just you know traffic right so we've got stoplights we've got yield signs we got traffic circles we've got you know the dead end sign you know that we don't want but we have stop signs we have on ramps off ramps all that and the cats super highway what I'm going to talk about today is the on ramp that first place that we plant our urban planning flag in mojo ville one word windows i'm waiting for like a fanfare like bugles why why is this the one place that's so important the first thing is cats are like little feline sundials if there's a sunny spot in the house there's going to be a cat in that sunny spot i don't care if it's on the floor or the ceiling there's going to be a cat in that spot they love the heat the vitamin d that comes in there they just feel that nice warm loveliness where is it going to come through where's the sun coming through what is that yes the window the second reason cats love the window is cat tv yeah it's it's like it's it's a tv screen and out there is you know Netflix there is bird feeders there are birds in the sky there are critters on the ground and if you're thinking to yourself well i don't know if there's that many birds or critters or anything outside my window well that's what bird feeders are for bird baths anything like that cat tv is there waiting for you and again you might think to yourself well how is this enriching to my cat to watch cat tv it's still engagement the raw cat is still engaged that hunter is still engaged you've seen your cat go you know that that thing the raw cat is still engaged i know you might think that that's awfully frustrating it's not that's why you play with your cat later in the day but right now it's just a way of engaging them so now we've got the sundial we have got cat tv we got passive raw cat engagement you understand now how the window is just your really close buddy pal so have i picked your interest yet well yes jackson i totally piqued my interest but how do i catify a window oh i am so glad you asked i'm so glad you asked let's talk about how to catify that window the first thing i need you to know because this is another source of paralysis sometimes it can work at any budget you want to spend some money talk to your aesthetic we can totally do that you want to just not spend any money we can do that or somewhere in the middle so the first thing you think about when it comes to i don't want to spend any money diy this thing i mean look look at this chair right here right if i just push this right up against the window then i got someplace for me to sit and my cat's hanging back there a lot of us do that anyway the couches are up against the living room windows chairs or whatever but that's a great place to start but you can do anything as long as it's window height there is something that you can move into the window so that your cat can just sit there see how simple that is now you want to put the cherry on top then you put one of those nice little cat beds we call it a chill mat and you can get one of the jackson galaxy storage just saying but you can also oh that's right jackson i don't want to spend any money take a favorite blanket that your cat loves to sit on a sweatshirt something like that even better something that smells like you it doesn't matter as long as they sit on it and by the way sometimes cats just don't like to sit on anything that nice cool console end table they're fine with that too let your cat tell you what they want but in the meantime you see what i'm saying you don't have to spend anything to start planting your flag in mojo bill and speaking of letting your cat tell you let their body tell you as well because you have to tailor anything that goes into the window based on your cat's potential physical capabilities or disabilities if you've got a senior cat and you're asking them to jump up on something that might be asking too much if that senior cat jumps down from that surface then if it's a wooden floor something like that their legs go whoop you know and so we want to mitigate that as well so think about perhaps a ramp that goes up to that table and again no money we're talking about a two by four we're talking about anything that you could just put against that end table and it's sturdy it's all you care about or little steps you know uh again if you want to spend a little bit of money pet steps are actually you can get them very inexpensively but again you can do anything just get your cat up into that window same thing goes for kittens same thing goes for blind cats or cats that have something like CH cerebellar hyperplasia which makes them a little wobbly just work it so that your cat can work it okay so now we did the no money now let's spend just a little bit of money just a little bit of money let's talk about something like the kitty sill is a product that I like or anything like it you've seen the ones with the suction cups they can be very inexpensive kitty sill is one that actually attaches into the window sill itself it's covered in fleece hello you're done one warning about the suction cup guys depending on the company and the product itself the suction cups can sometimes give way so a little bit of money maybe just a little bit more don't go for the very cheapest thing that you find on amazon read the reviews make sure because especially considering the weight of your cat do you need help i got you all it takes is that suction cup coming off once and your cat's never gonna go there again you know also depending on the height of the window i mean a lot of you guys have windows that are either floor to ceiling you lucky guys or it can be you know even like a couple of feet off the ground there are these wonderful cardboard loungers you know they're made out of strong cargated cardboard which are fantastic because they absorb scent they become those scent soakers that we really want in anything that's in the house yes i have another made up word the scent soaker is something oh wait hold on that soaks in your cat scent gives him that sense of mojo and belonging cardboard is a great thing for that and again not expensive at all i really really really would love you to do is the investment in cat trees and i just want you to remember depending on how much money you want to spend they can be not expensive at all and they can be very expensive and again it's about your aesthetic as long as they're sturdy that's all you care about do you have a cat tree in your house move it into a window or right adjacent to the window so even if they're in the corner they can get that sunshine watch the cat tv doesn't have to be dead center in the middle of the window but at least it will get used if you've got a cat tree that's not getting used in your house i can guarantee you the best chance you have of it being utilized by your cat is in the window but if you don't have a cat tree please get one and it doesn't have to be floor to ceiling again no paralysis by analysis here go for something that you don't think is ugly at least that at least gets them window height all we care about go for ideal again don't let perfection be the enemy of good let's go back to the idea of urban planning shall we yes we shall we're going to start building the the roads around mojo ville well guess what this window now becomes the on ramp it is the center of this whole thing from here springs the rest of catification the cat superhighway the thing that allows your cat to just traverse the entire room without touching the floor that is the kind of thing we're looking for but we're not looking for it today you have done everything that you need to do right now to make sure that your cat's mojo goes as a matter of fact if you haven't done it now go go to the window and put something in it and you tell me put something in the comments tomorrow did my cat go in the window yes your cat did but if no i want to hear about it too and if leaving a comment isn't good enough because you've had a revelation then i would love for you to go to this link right here and i'll put the link in the description as well and send me a video describing what you've done showing me your cat in the window making me feel good because i gave you something that actually worked for both you and your cat and speaking of making me happy which i know is your primary drive but it would be great if you subscribe to the channel if you left a comment if you really like this and gave it a thumbs up it's what makes this channel tick and ticking helps you and your cat not ticks ticks do not was there a place to cut in there that was i'm sure there was right yeah all right my friends that is your window of opportunity i'm so overjoyed with that all right all right my friends that is your window of opportunity for the day like i said you're going to thank me and so will your cat until next time all i'd all love all cat mojo tea and bye guys Wrath and life
